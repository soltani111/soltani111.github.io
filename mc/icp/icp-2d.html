<h1>Iterative Closest Point - ICP</h1>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>We first create two sets of toy dataset.</li>
        <li>We will call the first set of points the base points and will generate them using the latin hypercube sampling method</li>

        </div>
          <li>As you can see there are no two points in a row or a column.</li>
          <li>Then we define 2 functions for Rotation and Translation and apply that to the base point to get a second set of points.</li>

<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Now we are going to find the transformation that mapped base points (reference point sets) to the second transformed set of points aka. source point set.</li>
        <li>In order to do that we have to find a first estimate of a pair of points and the transformation between them.</li>
        <li>A good way to initialize our guess is to find the closest point to each point in the reference point set.</li>
        <li>After finding the closest point, we have to calculate the transformation that can map the point in reference set to that closest point of last step.</li>
        <li>In order to do that we have to first formulate the problem into a least square minimization problem because it has many robust and fast methods to solve and is easier too!</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Least Square Problem</h2>
<p>
        Assume that we have two point sets {p_i} and {p'_i}
        \[p'_i = R p_i + T\]
        where R is a 3x3 rotation matrix and T is a 3x1 translation vector.
        we can formulate a minimization problem to find \(R\) and \(T\) as follows:
        \[\min_{R,T} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \|p'_i - R p_i - T\|^2\]
        If the solution to the least square problem is \(\hat{R}\) and \(\hat{T}\), then the centroid of point set {p"_i} and 
        {p_i} are the same.
        \[p"_i = \hat{R} p_i + \hat{T}\]
        If we name the centroids of the two point sets as \(p_c\) and \(p'_c\), then we can translate the centroid of all the pointsets 
        to the origin and then the points would be like this:
        \[q_i = p_i - p_c\]
        \[q'_i = p'_i - p'_c\]
        now the original minimization problem is formulated as a least square problem:
        \[\min_{R,T} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \|q'_i - R q_i\|^2\]
        Then all we have to do is to find \(R\) by solving the above least square problem using SVD decomposition
        and then we can simply find \(T\) by putting the \(R\) into this equation:
        \[\hat{T} = p' - \hat{R}p\]
        In order to do that we first define the matrix H like this:
        \[H = q_i\dot q'_i\]
        Then we can find the SVD decomposition of H like this:
        \[H = U S V^T\]
        Then we get \(X\) to be:
        \[X = VU^T\]
        Then we have to calculate the determinant of X; if it was +1 then \(X\) is the rotation matrix we have been looking for! 
        if it was -1 then the algorithm has failed which is not so likely to happen.
