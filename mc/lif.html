<h1>One Color LIF Method for Temperature Measurement</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this project, we used the one-color Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) method to calculate the temperature of a fluid. This method leverages the fluorescent properties of certain particles, which, when excited by laser light at a specific wavelength, emit radiation in a particular range of electromagnetic waves. The intensity of this emitted light is dependent on temperature, allowing us to determine the fluid's temperature. This temperature dependence varies across different fluorescent materials; for most, the output radiation intensity increases as the temperature decreases.
</p>

<h2>Test Theory</h2>
<p>
The quantum efficiency \(Q\) plays a central role in this experiment and is influenced by several parameters:
<ul>
    <li>\(K_{\text{spec}}\) is the intensity of fluorescent radiation received by the camera.</li>
    <li>\(K_{\text{opt}}\) is the optical efficiency due to optical equipment.</li>
    <li>\(\epsilon_1\) and \(\epsilon_2\) are the absorption coefficients of the fluorescent material and laser light, respectively.</li>
    <li>\(C\) is the concentration of the fluorescent material.</li>
    <li>\(I_0\) is the intensity of the incoming laser light.</li>
    <li>\(b\) and \(z\) are the lengths of the paths traveled by the beam in the container and by the fluorescent radiation perpendicular to the laser sheet, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Given these parameters, the light emitted by the fluorescent materials is dependent on the temperature. This relationship is expressed by the equation:
</p>
<p>
\[
\frac{I_f}{I_{f_{\text{ref}}}} = e^{\beta\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_0}\right)}
\]
</p>
<p>
where:
<ul>
    <li>\(I_f\) is the fluorescence intensity in the test mode.</li>
    <li>\(I_{f_{\text{ref}}}\) is the fluorescence intensity in the reference mode.</li>
    <li>\(\beta\) is a coefficient determined experimentally.</li>
    <li>\(T\) and \(T_0\) are the test and reference temperatures, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
When the temperature is constant but the concentration changes, the relationship is given by:
</p>
<p>
\[
\frac{I_f}{I_{f_{\text{ref}}}} = \frac{C}{C_{\text{ref}}}
\]
</p>
<p>
This method assumes a uniform concentration of fluorescent particles throughout the container and low fluctuations of laser light intensity.
</p>

<h2>Test Equipment</h2>
<p>
The experimental setup involved creating a light sheet in the test container using a laser and a cylindrical lens. A camera, placed perpendicular to the laser sheet, captured images of the fluorescent emissions. The fluorescent substance used was Rhodamine B, a powder dissolved in water to produce a solution of known concentration. A filter was placed on the camera to ensure only light emitted by the fluorescent particles was captured, excluding any laser light interference. All experiments were conducted in a dark room to minimize the influence of external light sources.
</p>

<h2>Description of Experiment</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Preparation of Fluorescent Solution:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Dissolve Rhodamine particles in water.</li>
            <li>Stir with a magnetic stirrer until the solution becomes uniform.</li>
            <li>Determine the solution concentration, which serves as the reference concentration.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Concentration Measurement:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Inject a concentrated solution of Rhodamine into a container with a dilute solution using a syringe.</li>
            <li>Capture images to record the fluorescent emissions.</li>
            <li>Calculate concentration at any point using the images and reference data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Temperature Measurement:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Stir the uniform solution with a magnetic stirrer and measure the initial temperature (26°C). Take reference images.</li>
            <li>Heat the solution to 53°C while stirring continues to ensure uniform temperature distribution.</li>
            <li>Capture images at both temperatures to develop a calibration curve.</li>
            <li>Inject cold fluid into the container and take additional images to determine the temperature distribution using the calibration curve and experimental data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
By analyzing these images and employing the calibration curve, we accurately mapped the temperature distribution within the fluid.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Temperature Contour Visualization</h3>
<p>
To illustrate the results of our temperature measurements, we generated a contour map showing the temperature distribution within the fluid. This visualization provides a detailed view of how the temperature varies throughout the test container.
