<h1>Gaussian Process</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Gaussian Process</h2>
<p>
    Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate models approximate the behavior of the objective function based on a limited set of function evaluations. 
    GP modeling optimization is used for handling optimization due to its versatility and efficacy. A Gaussian process is a nonparametric model 
    with uncertainty predictions, providing an estimation of the variance along with the prediction.
</p>
<p>
    In general, a GP model can be expressed as:
    \[
    f(x) = \text{GP}\left(m(x), k(x,x')\right) \tag{1}
    \]
    where \(m(x)\) represents the mean function, which can be expressed as:
    \[
    m(x) = h(x)\beta \tag{2}
    \]
    Here, \(h(x)\) and \(\beta\) are the regression function and coefficient vector, respectively. The expression \(k(x,x')\) represents the variance 
    function at design point \(x\) and sample point \(x'\). The roughness parameters \(\theta_0, \theta_1, \ldots, \theta_j\) and the Gaussian kernel function 
    \(R(x-x')\) are given by:
    \[
    k(x,x') = \sigma^2 R(x-x') = \sigma^2 \exp\left(-\sum_{j=1}^u \theta_j \left(x_j - x_j'\right)^2\right) \tag{3}
    \]
</p>
<p>
    The likelihood of the estimated mean function is expressed below, where \(\beta, \sigma^2, \theta\) are hyper-parameters. The goal is to maximize the log-likelihood of the parameters.
    \[
    P(y | \beta, \sigma^2, \theta) = \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{N/2} |R|^{1/2}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (y - H\beta)^T R^{-1} (y - H\beta)\right) \tag{4}
    \]
</p>
<p>
    By calculating the partial derivative of the previous equation and setting its value to 0, the maximum likelihood of estimated functions is calculated.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of establishing a GP model is to predict the output response \(f_p(x_p)\) at design points \(x_p\). The considered output must 
    respond \(f_o(x_o)\) at input sample points \(x_o\). The prediction can be calculated by considering a joint distribution over the function values of 
    \(x_o\) and \(x_p\), denoted by \(f_o\) and \(f_p(x_p)\) respectively.
