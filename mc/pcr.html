<h1>Multi-Channel Real-Time PCR System</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project marks the first effort in Iran to develop a multi-channel real-time PCR system. My master's thesis, <em>"Optimizing the Temperature Changes of the Heating Cycle in Real-Time PCR,"</em> focuses on improving the device's heating and cooling systems. The PCR method involves a thermal cycle that operates between 65 to 95 degrees Celsius. Below is a picture of the device.</p>

<h2>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h2>
<p>This device requires a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction. I developed its GUI using the PyQt5 library in Python. Below is a short video demonstrating its functionality.</p>

<h2>Thermal Cycle Control</h2>
<p>To control the device's thermal cycle, we utilized an Arduino Uno board connected to a Raspberry Pi. The images captured by the Raspberry Pi were processed using the OpenCV library in Python. Below is an example of a processed image.</p>
