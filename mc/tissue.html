<h1>Bi-layered Vascular Graft Project</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we aimed to fabricate and characterize a bi-layered vascular graft with enhanced mechanical properties and biocompatibility. 
    This project involved a combination of advanced techniques including electrospinning, cell culturing, and mechanical testing to ensure the graft's performance in clinical applications. 
    Through this work, I developed and honed essential laboratory skills such as cell culturing, electrospinning, silk fibroin extraction, and in vitro graft fabrication.
</p>

<h2>Fabrication</h2>
<p>
    The inner layer of the graft was created using the electrospinning method, where nanofibers were developed by encapsulating heparin sodium within a TPU/silk fibroin matrix. 
    The outer layer, made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), was designed to enhance the graft's mechanical properties. This multi-layered structure was critical for achieving the desired balance between strength, flexibility, and biocompatibility.

<h2>Mechanical and Morphological Analysis</h2>
<p>
    The project involved extensive mechanical testing, including suture retention, tensile strength, and burst pressure tests to evaluate the graftâ€™s durability. 
    Additionally, the morphology of the graft was analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to assess fiber diameter and adhesion between layers. 
    These analyses confirmed that the graft had a suitable microstructure and mechanical integrity to function effectively as a vascular graft.
</p>

<h2>Biocompatibility and In Vitro Testing</h2>
<p>
    The biocompatibility of the graft was evaluated through cell culture experiments using Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs). 
    The cells were cultured on the graft and monitored through MTT assays and SEM imaging, demonstrating the graft's ability to support cell viability and proliferation. 
    The project also involved assessing the graft's anti-thrombogenic properties, with platelet adhesion tests showing promising results in preventing blood clot formation.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Overall, this project successfully developed a bi-layered vascular graft with excellent mechanical and biocompatibility characteristics. 
    The skills I acquired, including cell culturing, electrospinning, and mechanical testing, were crucial in conducting the comprehensive analysis required to validate the graft's potential for clinical applications.
