  id: Design and Optimization of Cooling Channel using PINN and Deep Gaussian Process
  description: >
    In this project, we aimed to design and optimize a cooling channel featuring a circular obstruction 
    using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). For the optimization process, we employed a Deep
    Gaussian Process. The results were satisfactory when compared to Computational Fluid Dynamics 
    (CFD) simulations.

  description: >
    In this study, first the 3D heat transfer problem is solved with FEniCS.
    Afterwards, the temperature data on the domain is used as ground truth
    data for a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). A comparison is
    made between the PINN and FEniCS data to evaluate the accuracy of the PINN model.

  description: >
    In this project, I explored the application of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to analyze velocity fields
    within fluid systems. By conducting experiments such as free convection and jet flow, I demonstrated
    how Python-based PIV can effectively measure particle displacement and compared the results with
    commercial PIV software for validation.

  id: 
  description: >
    In this project, we utilized the one-color Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) method to measure the 
    temperature of a fluid by analyzing the temperature-dependent fluorescence intensity emitted by
    hRhodamine B particles. Through controlled experiments involving laser excitation and image capture,
    we developed a calibration curve that allowed us to accurately map the temperature distribution 
    within the fluid.
